This repo contains two separate project, one in R and one in Python.

The Python project is quite large, so I have added both the full project and a sample of the same. It was done in collabroation with one classmate as the culmination of a Python class at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. The sample pulls data from the Cook County Assessor's Office and the National Renewable Energy Lab, cleans and merges the data, then maps the distribution of weather monitoring stations and vacant lots across Cook County. The full project goes on to investigate if there is a relationship between a joint variable of a lot's wind speed + vacancy status and the lot's distance to the lake, and then formats and exports the data for use in an interactive map in a Jupyter Notebook. The full project file takes about 20 minutes to run, and the sample runs in about a minute.

The R project is an investigation of the effect on a political party's midterm gains at the statehouse level of having won the governorship in the previous election cycle. I use a regression discontinuity design to investigate effects around the cutoff point of 50% voteshare, at which a party goes from not winning to winning the governorship. Though this is an observable phenomenon at the federal level, there do not appear to be significant effects at the state level, perhaps because local elections are much lower saliency.
